# C8 Coherence Benchmark

**Code-first benchmark for measuring coherence, synchronization, stability, and memory  
in dynamic signal-based systems.**

Anchored in **C8**, deterministic, repeatable, and verifiable via cryptographic hash.

---

## What this is

C8 Coherence Benchmark is a **universal measurement tool**, not a theory.

It provides a concrete, executable benchmark for evaluating:
- coherence (Σ),
- phase synchronization (PLV),
- entropy flow (ΔS),
- dynamic stability (Lyapunov),
- memory retention (MRI),
- anomaly and glitch resistance,

across **AI systems, signal-processing pipelines, and physical or hybrid architectures**.

No metaphors.  
No declarations.  
Only metrics, tests, and artefacts.

## Why it matters

Most frameworks *describe* coherence.  
This benchmark **measures it**.

Key properties:
- deterministic execution,
- identical input → identical output,
- cryptographic hashing of results,
- comparable runs across systems, time, and implementations.

This makes the benchmark suitable for:
- research validation,
- system comparison,
- regression detection,
- prior-art timestamping.

## Core principles

- **Framework-agnostic** – works on any signal-based system  
- **Code-first** – execution > narrative  
- **Metric-driven** – numbers, not interpretations  
- **Audit-ready** – every run produces a hashable artefact  

---

## Scope

The benchmark evaluates systems under multiple conditions:
- idle / baseline
- noise
- stress
- memory attack
- loop / recurrence

Each law returns:
- value,
- verdict (PASS / FAIL / NO DATA),
- diagnostic message.

## Status

- Active development
- Public research repository
- Deterministic reference implementation
